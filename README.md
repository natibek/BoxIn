This is a web game based on a ubiqutous childhood game played in Ethiopia. The name for the game is different from household to household but usually is 'dots' or 'points'. 'BoxIn' best represents the aim of the game for people who have never played, hence, is chosen as the English name for the game. The aim is to create a 1 by 1 box that will become your territory. You can place a line by joining any two points vertically or horizontally (given that have not already been joined). The player with the most territories wins. 

There is an Easy Level bot, you can play against. Higher difficulty bots will come out in the future.

There is also a multiplayer mode where you can play with your friends. You can also join the global lobby and play with someone new!
